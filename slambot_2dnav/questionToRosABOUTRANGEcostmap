 Hi all,

I'm having some issues adding ultrasonic sensors to my costmap. My robot was set up using the move_base setup guide, and uses a single Hokuyo lidar for SLAM with hector_mapping. It uses three costmaps: local_costmap_params.yaml, global_costmap_params.yaml and costmap_common_params.yaml.

To help get the ultrasonic data into the costmap(s) I made a simplified URDF model (instead of manually adding static transform publishers to launch files, as I did with the laser scanner). I've got data from a SRF05 into ROS and displaying as a cone from the front of my model in RVIZ, and after a bit of playing with the costmaps I've managed to get ultrasonic range data to register as inflated obstacles in the local costmap.

The problem is that when I add the sonar sensor to the costmap, I no longer have any lidar data in the costmap. Before I added the range_layer to the params.yaml file I could see a global and local costmap in rviz. Now that the sonar settings are in there too I only see the ultrasonic range costmap stuff inside the local costmap, and the global costmap is empty. I am getting errors out of the move_base terminal which read:

    [ERROR] [1486152698.562581761]: Range sensor layer can't transform from map to /ultrasound at 1486152698.395551

However there must be at least an intermittent transformation between map and /ultrasound because I can see the obstacles being added to the costmap in RVIZ, [as you can see here](https://s24.postimg.org/hvlqz37zp/range_Finder_RVIZ.png). For comparison, [this is what I get](https://s27.postimg.org/9bx6bltn7/range_Finder_RVIZNOSONIC.png) when I remove the "sonar_layer:" section and the "plugins:" section from costmap_common_params.yaml.

I'm not too sure what I'm doing in general with setting all this up (figuring it all out as I go along), so any advice or pointers from anyone would be greatly appreciated. 


Here are my costmap parameter files:

local_costmap_params.yaml:

    local_costmap:
      global_frame: /map
      robot_base_frame: base_link
      update_frequency: 6.0
      publish_frequency: 1.0
      static_map: false
      rolling_window: true
      width: 6.0
      height: 6.0
      resolution: 0.05
      transform_tolerance: 0.5
    
      obstacle_layer:
        observation_sources: laser_scan_sensor sonar_layer
        laser_scan_sensor: {sensor_frame: laser, data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true}

global_costmap_params.yaml:

    global_costmap:
      global_frame: /map
      robot_base_frame: base_link
      update_frequency: 6.0
      static_map: true

costmap_common_params.yaml:

    plugins:
      - {name: sonar_layer,   type: "range_sensor_layer::RangeSensorLayer"}
      - {name: inflation_layer, type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"}
    obstacle_range: 3
    raytrace_range: 9
    footprint: [[-0.162, -0.206], [-0.162, 0.206], [0.162, 0.206], [0.162, -0.206]]
    #old footprint: [[-0.12, -0.18], [-0.12, 0.18], [0.12, 0.18], [0.12, -0.18]]
    #robot_radius: ir_of_robot
    inflation_radius: 0.4
    transform_tolerance: 1.3
    
    observation_sources: laser_scan_sensor
    
    laser_scan_sensor: {sensor_frame: laser, data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true}
    
    sonar_layer:
      frame: ultrasound
      topics: ["/ultrasound"]
      no_readings_timeout: 1.0
      clear_on_max_reading: true

And [here is my URDF model](https://s28.postimg.org/s9lppfg65/RDFtree.png).

Please let me know if I should add any more information.

Many thanks,
